## Problem Statement
**Innovate to Conserve**: Develop a comprehensive solution to automate the identification, removal, use, and monitoring of the restoration process in the Shola forests.

1. **Smart Analysis System**: 
   - Utilizes advanced algorithms for land identification.
   - Automates the process of detecting areas in need of restoration.

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Developed a prototype to identify lantana from images.
   - Facilitates efficient removal of invasive species.

3. **Digitalized Data Collection**:
   - Streamlined the process of collecting and managing data.
   - Ensures accurate and up-to-date information for monitoring.

4. **NGO Contact List**:
   - Compiled a comprehensive list of contacts for NGOs involved in similar conservation efforts.
   - Enhances collaboration and information sharing.
